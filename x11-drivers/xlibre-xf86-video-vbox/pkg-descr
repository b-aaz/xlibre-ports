This package contains the XLibre xf86-video-vbox driver.

This driver is only for use in VirtualBox guests without the vboxvideo kernel
modesetting driver in the guest kernel, and which are configured to use the
VBoxVGA device instead of a VMWare-compatible video device emulation.

Guests with the vboxvideo kernel modesetting driver should use the Xorg
"modesetting" driver module instead of this one.
